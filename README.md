# ESRI-AppStudio-QT
This is a how to guide on the basics of creating an application using QT and AppStudio by ESRI. This guide is focused on map making, customization, and adding features to develop a custom app.  
## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
The following items need to be downloaded and/or are required in order to build a custom application on your computer.
1. ESRI Account
2. ESRI AppStudio
3. QT Creator (comes part of the package when AppStudio is downloaded)
4. (optional, but recommended) mobile device

### 1. ESRI Account
This application will not work without an account with ESRI. A standard license is required with ArcGIS in order to access ESRI's app building services.

### 2. ESRI AppStudio
Navigate to this [website](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/appstudio/download/) to find Appstudio on ESRI's website. Based on your computer, download the accurate version of your computer's platform under the highlighted section in the image below. There is no need to download AppStudio Player unless you want to visualize your applicaiton on your mobile device in which case you can access the app in iOS or Android. AppStudio software will also allow you to visualize the application on a small screen in its completion form. Note - for this tutorial, Windows x64 is the platform of choice.
